# 🤖 Gemini API Setup Guide for CognivexAI

## 🚀 **AI-POWERED EMAIL AUTOMATION WITH GEMINI**

I've implemented Gemini API for intelligent, AI-generated email content. This gives you:
- **Smart email generation** - Each email is unique and contextually appropriate
- **Professional tone** - AI ensures consistent, business-appropriate language
- **Dynamic content** - Emails adapt to specific lead information and meeting details

## **Step 1: Get Your Gemini API Key**

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click **"Create API Key"**
4. **Copy the API key** (starts with `AIza...`)

## **Step 2: Update Environment Variables**

Add this to your `.env.local` file:

```bash
# Gemini API Configuration
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyC...your_api_key_here
```

## **Step 3: Test Gemini Email Generation**

1. **Restart your development server**
2. **Test lead capture**: "My name is John, email john@test.com"
3. **Test meeting booking**: "Book a consultation for tomorrow at 2 PM"
4. **Check console logs** for Gemini API responses
